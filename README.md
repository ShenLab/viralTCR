# viralTCR
A machine learning method to predict TCR-peptide binding

## Project Aim
1. Predict binding specificity of TCR and peptides by machine learning
2. Search for SARS-CoV-2 peptides that elicit strong T cell response based on TCRs from COVID-19 patients. 

## Data
### Training and testing
TCR specificity ([VDJdb](https://vdjdb.cdr3.net/search)), also, see downloaded VDJdb_TCR.tsv
### Application
[10 patients TCR repertoire](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472v1.supplementary-material), also, see TCR.csv
[SARA-CoV-2 sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947), also, see virus_sequence.txt
### Verify
Sequence homology and MHC binding ability predicted [epitopes](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/pdf/S1931-3128(20)30166-9.pdf?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312820301669%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)
