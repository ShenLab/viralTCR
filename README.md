# viralTCR
A machine learning method to predict TCR-peptide binding

## Project Aim
1. Predict binding specificity of TCR and peptides by machine learning
2. Search for SARS-CoV-2 peptides that elicit strong T cell response based on TCRs from COVID-19 patients. 

## Training data
TCR specificity ([VDJdb](https://vdjdb.cdr3.net/search))
